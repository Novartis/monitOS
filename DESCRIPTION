Description: These guidelines are meant to provide a pragmatic, yet rigorous, help to drug developers and decision makers,
    since they are shaped by three fundamental ingredients: the clinically determined margin of detriment on OS that
    is unacceptably high (δnull); the benefit on OS that is plausible given the mechanism of action of the novel intervention (δalt);
    and the quantity of information (i.e. events, expected number of survival events, at primary and final analysis) it is 
    feasible to accrue given the clinical and drug development setting. The proposed guidelines facilitate
    transparent discussions between stakeholders focusing on the risks of erroneous decisions and what might 
    be an acceptable trade-off between power and the false positive error rate.
